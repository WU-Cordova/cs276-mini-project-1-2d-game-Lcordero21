# Pumpkin Dash

## Play the Game
**Unity Play Link**: 

## Game Overview
In this silly little game, you play as "Boo the Ghost" who is terrified of pumpkins since they are commonly used on halloween to scare off evil spirits. Be sure to not touch the pumpkins or you might get trapped forever in one! 

### Controls
- For this game you only need the left-mouse button, Boo will follow your mouse as long as you're holding it down.

### How to Play
- Fly around and avoid the pumpkins (and borders)! The difficulty will increase overtime.
